# Δ-Nim under Lipparini’s Dadaist Sums  
# Infinite-Combinatorial-Game-Sums-ISEF

## Project Overview

This repository studies **Δ-Nim**, a Nim-like impartial game on countably many heaps, defined using Lipparini’s infinite sum (Dadaist) framework for combinatorial games. [file:100]

We prove a **complete determinacy classification** of Δ-Nim positions based on the **support size** \(|\operatorname{supp}(h)|\):

- **Sparse case** \(|\operatorname{supp}(h)| \le 60\):  
  The position is winning for the next player (N-position) iff the **nim-sum** \(\oplus h \ne 0\). [file:145]

- **Dense finite case** \(60 < |\operatorname{supp}(h)| < \infty\):  
  Player II has a **pairing strategy** that maintains \(\oplus h = 0\), so every such position is a **P-position**.

- **Infinite support case** \(|\operatorname{supp}(h)| = \infty\):  
  Extending the dense pairing strategy using **infinitely many reserve heaps**, Player II again has a winning strategy; all infinite-support positions are **P-positions**.

**Research question (final form):**  
Is every Δ-Nim position \(h \in \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}\) completely determined by a **support-size density classification** (sparse / dense finite / infinite), with nim-sum deciding the sparse case and pairing strategies deciding the dense and infinite cases?

We combine:

- **Mathematical proofs** of the three cases above, and  
- **Machine learning** (Random Forest) trained on 50,000 labeled positions,

to show strong agreement between theory and empirical predictions.

> Note: Some filenames still say “Lipparini Nim” for historical reasons; the game studied here is Δ-Nim under Lipparini-style infinite sum rules.

## Methods

- **Game Definition (Δ-Nim):**  
  Positions are sequences \(h \in \mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}\) with countable support. Moves are standard Nim moves on a single heap, embedded in a Lipparini-style infinite sum rule (Dadaist sum) that ensures no loops and well-founded play. [file:100]

- **Theoretical Classification:**
  - Sparse case: \(|\operatorname{supp}(h)| \le 60\) → Bouton’s theorem applies; nim-sum fully decides N/P. [file:145]  
  - Dense finite case: \(60 < |\operatorname{supp}(h)| < \infty\) → Player II pairing strategy maintains \(\oplus h = 0\) and yields P-positions.  
  - Infinite support: \(|\operatorname{supp}(h)| = \infty\) → Extension of the dense pairing strategy using infinitely many reserves; Player II still wins (P-positions).

- **Simulation:**  
  Generate random Δ-Nim positions (with various support sizes), apply the theoretical classification to label positions, and record features such as heap sizes, support size, and nim-sum.

- **Machine Learning:**  
  Train a Random Forest classifier on the labeled dataset (~50k positions) to predict N/P outcomes. The best model achieves:
  - Test accuracy ≈ **0.9764**  
  - MCC ≈ **0.9253**  

  confirming that the simple density-based rules align extremely well with the position space explored.

- **Proof Exploration:**  
  The code supports experimentation and sanity checks around the conjectured/now-proved thresholds (e.g., support size 60) and helps explore alternative density cutoffs or variants.
